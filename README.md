# mtm6201-final

## Project Overview
This repository contains my final portfolio website for the MTM6201 User Experience Design course. The site consists of **3 pages** (Home, About, Contact), each with **at least three content sections** (excluding header and footer) to meet course requirements.

The website is built using the **Bootstrap framework** and is fully **responsive** across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The project emphasizes semantic HTML, accessibility, and clean, maintainable CSS.
